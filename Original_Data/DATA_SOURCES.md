# Data Source

All data is from the official data transmission for Ramboll Environ to CBEP in
2017, at the completion of Ramboll Environ's analysis of Casco Bay Sediment
chemistry data.

All data was derived from an Access database prepared by Ramboll Environ.
The full database, called “Casco Bay Sediment Data 1991_2001.accdb” and dated
February 1, 2017, is available from CBEP upon request.

The file **"Casco Bay Sediment Data Query.xlsx"** is the output of the
"Results_Env_withSums" query in that database, which is described in the
metadata as:

>  This is the final data query that contains all of the standardized sediment
data from the Casco Bay sediment dataset (1991-2011). 

The File **"Sums_Query.xlsx"** is the output of the "Sums" query, which is
described in the metadata as:

>  This query calculates the chemical sums (i.e., PAHs) in the Casco Bay
sediment data. It feeds the final Res_Env_withSums query.

THe file **"SQuiRTs.xlsx"** contains ERL and ERM values taken from the Ramboll
Environ Access database. IN particular it contains ERL (Effects Range Low) and
ERM (Effects Range Medium) values for selected parameters.  These values were,
in turn, derived from NOAA's SQuiRT tables.
